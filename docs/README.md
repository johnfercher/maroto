### News :new:

#### 1. Github Star
* Please, if you like maroto consider to nominate`@johnfercher`as a Github star. It's free!
* Link: https://stars.github.com/

#### 2. Discussion Opened:`Maroto Document Processor` :fire::fire::fire:: 

* We are about to create a document processor to generate PDFs by interpreting serialized data as: yml, json or html. Please contribute with your ideas in [this discussion](https://github.com/johnfercher/maroto/discussions/390).

#### 3. Maroto`v2.2.0`is here! Try out:

* Installation with`go get`:

```bash
go get github.com/johnfercher/maroto/v2@v2.2.0
```

The public API was completely redesigned with the aim of enhancing the 
library in various aspects. The main objectives of`v2.0.0`are:

1. [Improve usability](README.md?id=improve-usability);
2. [Allow unit testing](README.md?id=unit-testing);
3. [Add built-in metrics](README.md?id=built-in-metrics);
4. [Improve execution time](README.md?id=execution-time-improvement);
5. Allow recursive Row/Col; **(on roadmap)**
6. Allow generation based on [serialized data](https://github.com/johnfercher/maroto/discussions/390).

## Migration

1. We will no longer maintain the current version`v1.0.0`of maroto.
   - The last version`v0.43.0`was released as`v1.0.0`through the main branch, marking the end of the old version.
   - The old`v1`code was moved to a`v1`branch.
2. The master branch now keeps the`v2`code, being the default implementation now.
   - [Beta versions](https://go.dev/doc/modules/version-numbers) will be released as we achieve small deliverables.
   - There still some issues not solved from`v1`, but`v2`already solved more than 20 issues from`v1`.

## Code Example
This is part of the [simplest example](v2/examples/simplest?id=simplest).

## Maroto Columns and Rows

**Maroto** employs a flexible grid system to structure content in a PDF document, consisting of rows and columns. This system is designed to provide both simplicity and versatility in layout management.

### Columns

- **Grid System**: Maroto's layout is based on a 12-unit grid system. This means the width of each page is effectively divided into 12 equal parts (or "grid spaces").
- **Column Width**: When creating a column (using col.New(colSize)), the colSize parameter specifies how many of these 12 grid spaces the column should occupy. For example, col.New(1) creates a column that spans 1/12 of the page width, while col.New(6) spans half the page width.
- **Content Placement**: Columns are the primary containers for content such as text, images, and other components. The width of a column determines how much horizontal space its content occupies.
- **Total Width Constraint**: The sum of the widths of all columns within a single row should not exceed 12 grid spaces, aligning with the full width of the page.
- **Grid Space Customization**: Is possible to [customize](https://maroto.io/#/v2/features/maxgridsum?id=max-grid-sum) the max grid sum.

### Rows

- **Vertical Structuring**: Rows in Maroto are used to organize content vertically. Each row acts as a horizontal container for columns.
- **Row Height**: The height of a row is defined when it is created (e.g., row.New(20)). This height determines the vertical space allocated for the row. Unlike columns, row height is not based on a grid system but is a relative unit of `mm`.
- **Sequential Layout**: Rows are added to the document in the order they are defined, creating a top-to-bottom flow of content. Each new row is placed immediately below the preceding row.
- **Layout Flexibility**: Rows offer flexibility in the layout design, allowing for various configurations of columns within them. From single full-width columns to multiple columns of different widths, rows accommodate diverse layout patterns.


## Conventions

The way that maroto`v2`works is similar to the old version. The concept of components still exists, but now they are more 
rigorously controlled by maroto, meaning that`v2`will be less tightly integrated with [gofpdf][gofpdf]. This constraint will 
enable maroto`v2`to utilize other PDF providers, such as [pdfcpu][pdfcpu], in the future and even to generate other types 
of documents.

### Structure
In maroto`v2`, everything is a **component**. When you add a **row** to the document, you are essentially adding a
**component**. Similarly, when you add an **image** to a **col**, you are also introducing a **component**. The 
functioning of maroto`v2`is straightforward: it involves constructing a **components tree** and processing the 
tree by incorporating the **components** into the document.

### Runtime

Maroto`v2`now features a distinct separation into two runtime phases: **Declaration Phase** and **Generation Phase**.

1. **Declaration Phase:** During this phase, you will create the maroto instance, add various elements such as pages, rows, cols, images, and so on.
   - When calling the add methods, maroto will not make any changes to the document. Instead, it will solely construct the **components tree**.
2. **Generation Phase:** This phase is triggered when the `Generate() (Document, error)` method is called.
   - In this phase, maroto will traverse the **components tree** structure, compute the grid dimensions, and add components to the document.

## Improve Usability
The recursive design of maroto`v1`has proven to be a limiting factor in enhancing project features. This 
[issue][old_row_issue] was identified years ago. To enhance code quality and streamline the addition of new features, 
a refactor of the [maroto interface][old_maroto_interface] is necessary. This involves extracting interfaces for each 
feature within maroto, such as (Row, Col, Text, QRCode, Image, etc). With the new interfaces, usability will be greatly
improved, enabling maroto to reach a whole new level in this fresh new step.

### New Interfaces

## Unit Testing
In maroto`v2`, is be possible to write unit tests by analyzing the **components tree**. To facilitate the 
writing of unit tests, we created a dedicated test package.

For an example, refer to [this link](v2/features/unittests?id=unit-testing).

## Built-in Metrics
This new version of maroto introduces an **optional decorator** that provides metrics for nearly all operations 
performed by the library. When the decorator is enabled, maroto will populate the **report** struct within 
the **document** response.

The **report** struct contains the following information. For a complete example, refer 
to [this link](v2/basics?id=using-metrics-decorator).

## Execution Time Improvement
In Maroto`v2`, numerous performance enhancements have been implemented. The core algorithm is now **at least 
twice as fast as V1**. This disparity becomes even more remarkable when parallel generation is enabled. The 
subsequent results were achieved by generating a PDF with **100 pages** encompassing **all components supported** 
by Maroto`v2`.

[filename](../assets/text/parallel.txt ':include :type=code')

The PDF generated was a custom version of ([billing example](v2/examples/billing?id=billing)), with **100 pages**.
The pages are merged using [pdfcpu][pdfcpu]. For a complete example, please refer to
[this link](v2/features/parallelism?id=parallelism).
